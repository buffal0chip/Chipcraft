## Chipcraft Resource Pack Repo
This repo is here so that we can update the server resource pack as we play. Below are tutorials on how to modify the resource pack. Please follow the directions closely so that nothing gets messed up.
Upon pushing the changes, it may take around 10 minutes for the resource pack to update on the server. After that just leave and rejoin the server and the changes should be applied. In order for anyone to see the changes they must individually leave and rejoin the server.

# Chipcraft Resource Pack Repo
This repo is here so that we can update the server resource pack as we play. Below are tutorials on how to modify the resource pack. Please follow the directions closely so that nothing gets messed up. Please do not edit anything that is not in the directions below.

Upon pushing the changes, it may take around 10 minutes for the resource pack to update on the server. After that just leave and rejoin the server and the changes should be applied. In order for anyone to see the changes they must individually leave and rejoin the server.

# Blockbench
Blockbench is a program (that can be run from a web browser) that allows you to easily create custom models for Minecraft. If you want to make a custom model for any of the following tutorials you will want to use a "java block/item" model. From there there are plenty of tutorials online or you can ask me. However, making a custom model is not  necessary for most of the options. Here is the link to Blockbench:
